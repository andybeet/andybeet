### About me

Hi! I'm Andy. I am a research scientist and analyst (with [IBSS](https://www.ibsscorp.com/)) in support of NOAA Fisheries. As a proponent of open science principles I strive to show by example the importance of reproducible workflows, transparency in methodologies, and that collaboration is a necessity for advancing scientific and policy based work. This philosophy is applied to all of my work. To read more please visit [andybeet.com](https://andybeet.com)
